## Features:
- Designed specifically for the Xbox!
- Replaces Claude with "Claudia", a genderswapped version of Claude. (Includes prison outfit + cutscene models!)
- Replaces the heads up display with a Liberty City Stories style HUD + off-white weapon icons.
- Replaces the beeper with a classic "iFruit" style beeper!
- Modifies certain subtitles and images to replace all references of Claude with Claudia.
- Replaces menu assets with new images showing off the new protagonist!
- Replaces the radar with a much more detailed one!

# Tools Required:
- ImgTool 2.0
- MagicTXD (if you want to swap out textures)
- extract-xiso or similar XISO extraction utility if using an XISO copy of GTA III, or software to back up an Xbox DVD onto your system if you haven't already.

## Installation:
- Replace the contents of your "TXD" folder in GTA III with the contents in the "TXD" folder from Claudia's Requiem
- Replace the contents of your "TEXT" folder in GTA III with the contents in the "TEXT" folder from Claudia's Requiem
- Use ImgTool 2.0 to replace (or delete then re-add) model files with the ones found in the "models" folder from Claudia's Requiem

## Issues:
- Claudia's ponytail only appears in cutscenes for some reason. She still looks fine in-game, though, just missing her ponytail! Just imagine she puts her hair up before meetings.
